Task Overview:
In this task, you will set up Python, learn basic NumPy and Pandas operations, and create simple data visualizations using Matplotlib.

Week 1
Task Requirements
Understanding Data Science & Python Setup
Write a short 300-word summary on: o What is Data Science? o Difference between Data Science, AI, and Machine Learning o Real-world Applications of Data Science
Save this in a Markdown file (DataScience_Intro.md).
Install Python (>=3.8).
Install required libraries: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
Create a requirements.txt file listing installed libraries: pip freeze > requirements.txt
2Ô∏è. NumPy & Pandas Basics NumPy Task:

Write a Python script (numpy_basics.py) that: o Creates a NumPy array with random numbers. o Prints basic operations (sum, mean, max, min).
Pandas Task:

Write a Python script (pandas_basics.py) that: o Reads a small sample CSV file (Create one manually if needed). o Prints the first five rows of the dataset. o Displays basic statistics of the dataset.
3. Basic Data Visualization

Write a Python script (data_visualization.py) that: o Generates random data and plots a line graph using Matplotlib. o Saves the plot as an image (plot.png).
